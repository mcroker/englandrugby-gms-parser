Dear {{ person.firstName }},

Thank-you for renewing your TWRFC membership.

You are receiving this email as you have one (or more) children with paid-up membership, but are not currently registered as players. 
These are: {{ childrensNames }}

Somewhat counter-intuatively age-grade player registration is a totally separate process from membership and required inorder to play age-grade rugby (even at U6s!). We are required by RFU Regulations that All Age Grade Players must be registered on the RFUâ€™s online Game Management system (GMS) within 45 days of them first joining the Club.

You can complete Age Grade Registration online in GMS using the instructions at http://twrfc.com/reg/update.

If the ommission is intentional and they won't be playing at TWRFC - can you let me know at support@twrfc.com and I will remove them from the database (and you will stop getting these emails)

Note - This is an automated email.

Thanks
Martin
TWRFC Membership Secretary
