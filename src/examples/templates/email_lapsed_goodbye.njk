Dear {{ person.firstName }},
                    
I am contacting you as one or more of your children was a member of TWRFC last-season but seems to not have renewed this season.
If you think this is an error (and with GMS all things are possible), please reply to this email and I'll help to resolve.  In some circumstances people end up with multiple records that causes them to erroneously fall into filters.

The lapsed members are: {{ childrensNames }}

As their membership has lapsed, I will shortly be deregistering the above players and removing them from the club database.
If there are factors I might be unaware of please let me know ASAP and I will try to help resolve.

We're sorry to see them go... they will be most welcome back if they change their mind.
If you reconsider the decision to leave, Membership is available at a reduced rate for anybody joining post-Christmas.

Membership can be renewed using the instructions at https://twrfc.com/mem/buy.

Note - This is an automated email.

Thanks
Martin
TWRFC Membership Secretary
